# TbK mini Wiresless 

- This repo contains the source code for the ZMK module TBK mini wireless. 


*Important!: Overall notes as I'm stil building and testing.* 

## Building 

Using the template provided by ZMK (Link here), github actions is included from the get to. 
If you want to build locally I've created a simple bash script to prompt and use ZMK container for easy environment setup and usage. 

### Local building setup guide. 

NOTE! `not done`
1. Use the docker_shell.sh bash script 
```
./docker_shell west <command>
```
The script will bind this repo as ZMK module and set the config folder as config for the ZMK environment. 


## Creating the layout 

https://zmk-physical-layout-converter.streamlit.app/ <- Physical layout converter. Convert from json format, which is used in QMK and maybe others that i'm not aware of. 
https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-layout-tools/ <- Text rendering tool 
https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-layout-tools/ <- keymap layout editor. Input is json file and current keymap file to further edit.
